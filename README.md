## Installation

**Run locally with Gulp:**

`> npm install`

**Build for production:**

`> npx gulp`

## Technologies Used

Wordpress, Javascript, PHP, CSS, HTML.

## Learnings

My time could have been better managed to finish this project.  The styling took longer than expected, and I seemed to keep finding new pages to style!  I feel like I've started getting faster with css, and have been better at using variables.

As a first wordpress project, I was able to effectively alter the php of a few pages based off of the examples provided in the code-alongs.

## Acknowledgement

The starter theme was provided by RED Academy, and was forked from Underscores.
